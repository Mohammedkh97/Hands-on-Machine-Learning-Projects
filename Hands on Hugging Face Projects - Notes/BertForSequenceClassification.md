## üß† Fully understand what `BertForSequenceClassification` is and how it works.

## üî∑ What is `BertForSequenceClassification`?

`BertForSequenceClassification` is a **pretrained BERT model with an added classification head** ‚Äî a simple linear (dense) layer on top.
It‚Äôs used for tasks like:

* Sentiment analysis
* Spam detection
* Intent classification
* Natural Language Inference (NLI)
* GLUE benchmark tasks, etc.

It's part of the ü§ó **Hugging Face Transformers** library, and it is a subclass of `torch.nn.Module` ‚Äî meaning you can use it just like any PyTorch model.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Components

### 1. **Configuration (`BertConfig`)**

You can initialize the model from scratch using:

```python
from transformers import BertConfig, BertForSequenceClassification

config = BertConfig(num_labels=2)  # Binary classification
model = BertForSequenceClassification(config)
```

But usually you‚Äôll load it like this (loads weights + config):

```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification

model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=2)
```

---

### 2. **Forward Method & Inputs**

#### The model‚Äôs `.forward()` accepts:

| Parameter              | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `input_ids`            | Token indices of your text after tokenization.                            |
| `attention_mask`       | Tells BERT which tokens are padding (0 = ignore).                         |
| `token_type_ids`       | Used to distinguish sentence A and B (for tasks like question-answering). |
| `labels`               | Optional. If provided, the model returns a loss as well.                  |
| `output_attentions`    | If True, model will also return attention weights.                        |
| `output_hidden_states` | If True, model will return all intermediate hidden states.                |

#### Minimal usage:

```python
outputs = model(input_ids=batch_input_ids, attention_mask=batch_attention_mask)
logits = outputs.logits  # Shape: (batch_size, num_labels)
```

#### If you include `labels`, you get:

```python
loss, logits = model(input_ids, attention_mask, labels=labels).values()
```

## üîç What are Input IDs?

These are integer IDs representing each token in your text. Example:

```text
"I love AI" ‚Üí ['[CLS]', 'i', 'love', 'ai', '[SEP]']
            ‚Üí [101, 1045, 2293, 9933, 102]
```

> Generated by a tokenizer like `BertTokenizer`.

---

## üîç What is Attention Mask?

It tells BERT which tokens are real and which are padding.

Example:

```text
"I love AI" + padding ‚Üí input_ids:      [101, 1045, 2293, 9933, 102, 0, 0]
                                 ‚Üí attention_mask: [  1,    1,    1,    1,   1, 0, 0]
```

---

## üîç What is Token Type ID?

Used to distinguish between Sentence A and B in tasks like NLI or Q\&A.
In simple classification (one sentence), it's usually all zeros.

---

## üîç What is Position ID?

BERT includes positional embeddings (to understand order). These are usually generated automatically, so you rarely need to provide them unless customizing deeply.

---

## ‚úÖ What Does the Model Return?

### If `labels=None`:

```python
{
  "logits": Tensor(batch_size, num_labels)
}
```

### If `labels` are provided:

```python
{
  "loss": Tensor(1),
  "logits": Tensor(batch_size, num_labels)
}
```

You can also ask it to return:

* `hidden_states`: Outputs of all intermediate layers.
* `attentions`: Attention weights from all layers.

| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BertForSequenceClassification` | BERT + linear layer for classification tasks.            |
| `input_ids`                     | Tokenized and encoded input text.                        |
| `attention_mask`                | Mask to ignore padding tokens during attention.          |
| `labels`                        | Optional. If given, returns loss for training.           |
| `logits`                        | Raw model scores (before softmax).                       |
| `from_pretrained()`             | Load pretrained weights + config.                        |
| `forward()`                     | Run the model. Usually called indirectly via `__call__`. |
