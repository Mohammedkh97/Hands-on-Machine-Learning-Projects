## üß† Fully understand what `BertForSequenceClassification` is and how it works.

---

## üî∑ What is `BertForSequenceClassification`?

`BertForSequenceClassification` is a **pretrained BERT model with an added classification head** ‚Äî a simple linear (dense) layer on top.
It‚Äôs used for tasks like:

* Sentiment analysis
* Spam detection
* Intent classification
* Natural Language Inference (NLI)
* GLUE benchmark tasks, etc.

It's part of the ü§ó **Hugging Face Transformers** library, and it is a subclass of `torch.nn.Module` ‚Äî meaning you can use it just like any PyTorch model.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Components

### 1. **Configuration (`BertConfig`)**

You can initialize the model from scratch using:

```python
from transformers import BertConfig, BertForSequenceClassification

config = BertConfig(num_labels=2)  # Binary classification
model = BertForSequenceClassification(config)
```

But usually you‚Äôll load it like this (loads weights + config):

```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification

model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=2)
```

---

### 2. **Forward Method & Inputs**

#### The model‚Äôs `.forward()` accepts:

| Parameter              | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `input_ids`            | Token indices of your text after tokenization.                            |
| `attention_mask`       | Tells BERT which tokens are padding (0 = ignore).                         |
| `token_type_ids`       | Used to distinguish sentence A and B (for tasks like question-answering). |
| `labels`               | Optional. If provided, the model returns a loss as well.                  |
| `output_attentions`    | If True, model will also return attention weights.                        |
| `output_hidden_states` | If True, model will return all intermediate hidden states.                |

#### Minimal usage:

```python
outputs = model(input_ids=batch_input_ids, attention_mask=batch_attention_mask)
logits = outputs.logits  # Shape: (batch_size, num_labels)
```

#### If you include `labels`, you get:

```python
loss, logits = model(input_ids, attention_mask, labels=labels).values()
```

## üîç What are Input IDs?

These are integer IDs representing each token in your text. Example:

```text
"I love AI" ‚Üí ['[CLS]', 'i', 'love', 'ai', '[SEP]']
            ‚Üí [101, 1045, 2293, 9933, 102]
```

> Generated by a tokenizer like `BertTokenizer`.

---

## üîç What is Attention Mask?

It tells BERT which tokens are real and which are padding.

Example:

```text
"I love AI" + padding ‚Üí input_ids:      [101, 1045, 2293, 9933, 102, 0, 0]
                                 ‚Üí attention_mask: [  1,    1,    1,    1,   1, 0, 0]
```

---

## üîç What is Token Type ID?

Used to distinguish between Sentence A and B in tasks like NLI or Q\&A.
In simple classification (one sentence), it's usually all zeros.

---

## üîç What is Position ID?

BERT includes positional embeddings (to understand order). These are usually generated automatically, so you rarely need to provide them unless customizing deeply.

---

## ‚úÖ What Does the Model Return?

### If `labels=None`:

```python
{
  "logits": Tensor(batch_size, num_labels)
}
```

### If `labels` are provided:

```python
{
  "loss": Tensor(1),
  "logits": Tensor(batch_size, num_labels)
}
```

You can also ask it to return:

* `hidden_states`: Outputs of all intermediate layers.
* `attentions`: Attention weights from all layers.

## üß† Summary

| Component                       | Purpose                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BertForSequenceClassification` | BERT + linear layer for classification tasks.            |
| `input_ids`                     | Tokenized and encoded input text.                        |

### ‚úÖ Actual TrainingArguments of the transformer:
- To get the acual arguments, have a look at the transformer code and documentation.
- Then, select the needed arguments and strat training.

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="steps",
    eval_steps=500,
    save_strategy="steps",
    save_steps=500,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    logging_dir="./logs",
    logging_steps=10,
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    metric_for_best_model="accuracy",
)
```

---

  *Note*

* Run this on GPU if you have enough VRAM by set the argument `no_cuda=False`.
* Use `Trainer` for training and evaluation.
* Export predictions or evaluation results

Great! Since you're using the ü§ó `Trainer` and `TrainingArguments`, your training metrics are automatically logged during training.

---

### ‚úÖ Plotting the evolution of metrics (loss & accuracy) over training steps

We'll use the `trainer.state.log_history`, which stores all logs including:

* `loss`
* `eval_loss`
* `eval_accuracy`
* `step`

---

### ‚úÖ Code: Plotting loss & accuracy from `trainer.state.log_history`

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Extract logged history
logs = trainer.state.log_history

# Prepare lists for plotting
steps = []
train_loss = []
eval_loss = []
eval_accuracy = []

for entry in logs:
    if 'loss' in entry and 'step' in entry:
        train_loss.append(entry['loss'])
        steps.append(entry['step'])
    if 'eval_loss' in entry:
        eval_loss.append(entry['eval_loss'])
    if 'eval_accuracy' in entry:
        eval_accuracy.append(entry['eval_accuracy'])

# Plot training & evaluation loss
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(steps, train_loss, label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(steps[:len(eval_loss)], eval_loss, label='Validation Loss')
plt.xlabel("Steps")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.title("Loss over Training Steps")
plt.legend()

# Plot accuracy
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(steps[:len(eval_accuracy)], eval_accuracy, label='Validation Accuracy', color='green')
plt.xlabel("Steps")
plt.ylabel("Accuracy")
plt.title("Validation Accuracy over Steps")
plt.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

---

### üîç Notes:

* This works **without TensorBoard**, using only `trainer.state.log_history`.
* Make sure you‚Äôve run `trainer.train()` first so `log_history` is populated.
* If accuracy doesn‚Äôt appear, double-check that your `compute_metrics()` is correctly defined and passed.

---

### üì¶ Optional: Save Plots to File

If you want to save the figures:

```python
plt.savefig("training_metrics.png")
```

---

- Here's how to plot training, validation, and test accuracy in a single graph after training your model using Hugging Face's Trainer.


### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Training Accuracy**:

   * Logged during training via `log_history`.

2. **Validation Accuracy**:

   * Also logged automatically if `evaluation_strategy='steps'` and `compute_metrics` is set.

3. **Test Accuracy**:

   * Must be manually evaluated using `trainer.evaluate(test_dataset)`.

---

### ‚úÖ Full Code: Plot Train, Validation, and Test Accuracy

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Evaluate on test dataset after training
test_metrics = trainer.evaluate(test_encoded)
test_accuracy = test_metrics["eval_accuracy"]
print("‚úÖ Test Accuracy:", test_accuracy)

# Step 2: Extract from log history
logs = trainer.state.log_history
train_steps, train_loss, val_loss, val_accuracy = [], [], [], []

for entry in logs:
    if 'loss' in entry and 'step' in entry:
        train_steps.append(entry['step'])
        train_loss.append(entry['loss'])
    if 'eval_accuracy' in entry:
        val_accuracy.append(entry['eval_accuracy'])
    if 'eval_loss' in entry:
        val_loss.append(entry['eval_loss'])

# Step 3: Plot accuracy
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

# Plot validation accuracy
plt.plot(train_steps[:len(val_accuracy)], val_accuracy, label="Validation Accuracy", marker='o', color='blue')

# Plot test accuracy as horizontal line
plt.axhline(y=test_accuracy, color='red', linestyle='--', label=f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.3f}")

# Optional: Plot training loss curve (for reference)
plt.plot(train_steps, train_loss, label="Training Loss", linestyle='dotted', color='gray')

plt.xlabel("Training Steps")
plt.ylabel("Accuracy / Loss")
plt.title("Model Accuracy Over Time")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

---

### üìå Notes:

* **Training Accuracy** is **not automatically computed** unless you do it manually or via metrics logging. Hugging Face `Trainer` typically logs only:

  * `train_loss`
  * `eval_loss`
  * `eval_accuracy`

* If you want **true training accuracy**, you can evaluate on `train_dataset`:

  ```python
  train_metrics = trainer.evaluate(train_dataset)
  print("Train Accuracy:", train_metrics["eval_accuracy"])
  ```

* Then add:

  ```python
  plt.axhline(y=train_metrics["eval_accuracy"], color='green', linestyle='--', label=f"Train Accuracy: {train_metrics['eval_accuracy']:.3f}")
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ Final Result:

You‚Äôll get a plot showing:

* **Validation accuracy (curve)**
* **Test accuracy (dashed red line)**
* **(Optional) Train accuracy (dashed green line)**
* **Training loss (dotted gray line)**

If the Hugging Face `Trainer` training or evaluation is taking a long time, there are several possible **bottlenecks**, especially since you're running with `no_cuda=True` (CPU only):

---

### üîç Reasons Why It's Slow

#### 1. **Running on CPU (`no_cuda=True`)**

* Training transformer models like BERT or RoBERTa on CPU is **extremely slow**.
* Even a small dataset can take **minutes to hours per epoch**.

‚úÖ **Solution**:

* If you have a GPU, remove `no_cuda=True` or set it to `False`:

  ```python
  no_cuda=False
  ```

  Hugging Face will automatically use the available GPU.

To check if GPU is available:

```python
from transformers import is_torch_available
import torch
print("GPU Available:", torch.cuda.is_available())
```

---

#### 2. **Model Size**

* Even a **base transformer** (like BERT-base or DistilBERT) has \~100M+ parameters.
* On CPU, matrix operations are not optimized for deep learning workloads.

---

#### 3. **Large Batch Size**

* Larger `per_device_train_batch_size` consumes more memory and time per step.
* You are using `batch_size=8`, which is reasonable on CPU, but still adds up.

‚úÖ Try `batch_size=4` if memory or CPU is limited:

```python
per_device_train_batch_size=4
```

---

#### 4. **Logging, Evaluation, and Saving Too Frequently**

* You are evaluating & saving **every 500 steps**. On CPU, this is expensive.

‚úÖ Solution:

* Increase intervals:

```python
eval_steps=1000
save_steps=1000
logging_steps=100
```

---

#### 5. **Number of Epochs**

* Even 3 epochs on CPU = 3 full dataset passes = slow.

‚úÖ Solution:

* Start with `num_train_epochs=1` for faster experimentation.

---

#### 6. **Dataset Size**

* You‚Äôre training on 4000 samples and evaluating on 1000.
* Depending on the model and sequence length, that‚Äôs still compute-heavy on CPU.

‚úÖ Try smaller samples for initial runs:

```python
train_dataset = train_encoded.select(range(1000))
eval_dataset = train_encoded.select(range(1000, 1200))
```

---

### ‚úÖ Recommended Fast Debug Settings

Use these settings to iterate fast during development:

```python
TrainingArguments(
    ...
    num_train_epochs=1,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,
    eval_steps=1000,
    save_steps=1000,
    logging_steps=50,
    no_cuda=False,  # if you have a GPU
)
```
